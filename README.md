EA.log is the log file produced by the EA when evovlving the behaviours for Kilobox. The first columns represent the a, b, c and random seed that were tested. The final column is the score achieved by that set of inputs.

The first runs, where the behaviour is not written were carried out using the en-route behaviour, as this was the first behaviour that the EA was used to optimise. Some of the data is repeated, so that it could be used as input to for the first generation of another run of the EA.
